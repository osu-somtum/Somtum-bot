# TODO
- Leaderboard
- Player lastest score

# WIP
- Players status (Finish but not that much)

# Finished
- Linked discord account with bancho.py
- Server Status
- My profile to confirm discord link with bancho
- Total online players
  
# How to setup
clone this repo and `npm i` OR `yarn` (for archlinux) or `yarnpkg` for Debian/Ubuntu based distro

You must run `node deploy-commands.js` before `node .` or `node index` because if not, slash command will won't be imported to discord!

Docker is not required!, Fact. I didn't design this for docker ;-;

# What you need?
- MYSQL
- BANCHO.PY (with modded api/sql, open-source soon)
- GMAIL ACCOUNT (Google workspace, with less secure enabled)
